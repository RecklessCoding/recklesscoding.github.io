	abstract = {Value alignment in computer science research is often used to refer to the process of aligning artificial intelligence with humans, but the way the phrase is used often lacks precision. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review to advance the understanding of value alignment in artificial intelligence by characterising the topic in the context of its research literature. We use this to suggest a more precise definition of the term. We analyse 172 value alignment research articles that have been published in recent years and synthesise their content using thematic analyses. Our analysis leads to six themes: value alignment drivers & approaches; challenges in value alignment; values in value alignment; cognitive processes in humans and AI; human-agent teaming; and designing and developing value-aligned systems. Conclusions: By analysing these themes in the context of the literature we define value alignment as an ongoing process between humans and autonomous agents that aims to express and implement abstract values in diverse contexts, while managing the cognitive limits of both humans and AI agents and also balancing the conflicting ethical and political demands generated by the values in different groups. Our analysis gives rise to a set of research challenges and opportunities in the field of value alignment for future work.},

    abstract = {The ''right to contest'' decisions that have consequences on individuals or the society is a well-established democratic right. Contesting a decision is not a matter of simply providing an explanation, but rather of assessing whether the decision and the explanation are permissible against an organization's governance framework. Yet, albeit the popularity of adjacent fields, little work has been explicitly done on contesting AI decisions. In this paper, we propose that formal argumentation can be used to formulate contestations of decisions made by artificial agents. We extend the discourse on socio-ethical values in AI by conceptualizing our argumentation framework as a formal dialogue, enabling the interaction between humans and agents as decisions are being contested.},

	abstract = {Sociotechnical requirements shape the governance of artificially intelligent (AI) systems. In an era where embodied AI technologies are rapidly reshaping various facets of contemporary society, their inherent dynamic adaptability presents a unique blend of opportunities and challenges. Traditional regulatory mechanisms, often designed for static—or slower-paced—technologies, find themselves at a crossroads when faced with the fluid and evolving nature of AI systems. Moreover, typical problems in AI, for example, the frequent opacity and unpredictability of the behavior of the systems, add additional sociotechnical challenges.
To address these interconnected issues, we introduce the concept of dynamic certification, an adaptive regulatory framework specifically crafted to keep pace with the continuous evolution of AI systems. The complexity of these challenges requires common progress in multiple domains: technical, socio-governmental, and regulatory. Our proposed transdisciplinary approach is designed to ensure the safe, ethical, and practical deployment of AI systems, aligning them bidirectionally with the real-world contexts in which they operate. By doing so, we aim to bridge the gap between rapid technological advancement and effective regulatory oversight, ensuring that AI systems not only achieve their intended goals but also adhere to ethical standards and societal values.},

	abstract = {Variable autonomy equips a system, such as a robot, with mixed initiatives such that it can adjust its independence level based on the task's complexity and the surrounding environment. Variable autonomy solves two main problems in robotic planning: the first is the problem of humans being unable to keep focus in monitoring and intervening during robotic tasks without appropriate human factor indicators, and the second is achieving mission success in unpredictable and uncertain environments in the face of static reward structures. An open problem in variable autonomy is developing robust methods to dynamically balance autonomy and human intervention in real-time, ensuring optimal performance and safety in unpredictable and evolving environments. We posit that addressing unpredictable and evolving environments through an addition of rule-based symbolic logic has the potential to make autonomy adjustments more contextually reliable and adding feedback to reinforcement learning through data from mixed-initiative control further increases efficacy and safety of autonomous behavior.},

	abstract = {This article surveys the Variable Autonomy (VA) robotics literature that considers two contributory elements to Trustworthy AI: transparency and explainability. These elements should play a crucial role when designing and adopting robotic systems, especially in VA where poor or untimely adjustments of the system’s level of autonomy can lead to errors, control conflicts, user frustration, and ultimate disuse of the system. Despite this need, transparency and explainability is, to the best of our knowledge, mostly overlooked in VA robotics literature or is not considered explicitly. In this article, we aim to present and examine the most recent contributions to the VA literature concerning transparency and explainability. In addition, we propose a way of thinking about VA by breaking these two concepts down based on: the mission of the human-robot team; who the stakeholder is; what needs to be made transparent or explained; why they need it; and how it can be achieved. Last, we provide insights and propose ways to move VA research forward. Our goal with this article is to raise awareness and inter-community discussions among the Trustworthy AI and the VA robotics communities.},

There is no single approach that is best suited for a given context. This paper aims to address the challenge of selecting the most appropriate explainer given the context in which an explanation is required. For AI explainability to be effective, explanations and how they are presented needs to be oriented towards the stakeholder receiving the explanation. If—in general—no single explanation technique surpasses the rest, then reasoning over the available methods is required in order to select one that is context-appropriate. Due to the transparency they afford, we propose employing argumentation techniques to reach an agreement over the most suitable explainers from a given set of possible explainers. In this paper, we propose a modular reasoning system consisting of a given mental model of the relevant stakeholder, a reasoner component that solves the argumentation problem generated by a multi-explainer component, and an AI model that is to be explained suitably to the stakeholder of interest. By formalizing supporting premises—and inferences—we can map stakeholder characteristics to those of explanation techniques. This allows us to reason over the techniques and prioritise the best one for the given context, while also offering transparency into the selection decision. },

Low public trust and attitudes towards AI reinforce the need for concrete policy around its development and use. However, current guidelines and standards rolled out by institutions globally are considered by many as high-level and open to interpretation, making them difficult to put into practice. This paper presents ongoing research in the field of Responsible AI and explores numerous methods of operationalising AI ethics. If AI is to be effectively regulated, it must not be considered as a technology alone—AI is embedded in the fabric of our societies and should thus be treated as a socio-technical system, requiring multi-stakeholder involvement and employment of continuous value-based methods of assessment. When putting guidelines and standards into practice, context is of critical importance. The methods and frameworks presented in this paper emphasise this need and pave the way towards operational AI ethics.},

   abstract = {As robots are introduced to various domains and applications, Human-Robot Teaming (HRT) capabilities are essential. Such capabilities involve teaming with humans in/on/out-the-loop at different levels of abstraction, leveraging the complementing capabilities of humans and robots. This requires robotic systems with the ability to dynamically vary their level or degree of autonomy to collaborate with the human(s) efficiently and overcome various challenging circumstances. Variable Autonomy (VA) is an umbrella term encompassing such research, including but not limited to shared control and shared autonomy, mixed-initiative, adjustable autonomy, and sliding autonomy. This workshop is driven by the timely need to bring together VA-related research and practices that are often disconnected across different communities as the field is relatively young. The workshop's goal is to consolidate research in VA. To this end, and given the complexity and span of Human-Robot systems, this workshop will adopt a holistic trans-disciplinary approach aiming to a) identify and classify related common challenges and opportunities; b) identify the disciplines that need to come together to tackle the challenges; c) identify and define common terminology, approaches, methodologies, benchmarks, and metrics; d) define short- and longterm research goals for the community. To achieve these objectives, this workshop aims to bring together industry stakeholders, researchers from fields under the banner of VA, and specialists from other highly related fields such as human factors and psychology. The workshop will consist of a mix of invited talks, contributed papers, and an interactive discussion panel, toward a shared vision for VA. },

AWKWARD agents can have their plans re-configured in real time to align with social role requirements under changing environmental and social circumstances. The proposed hybrid architecture makes use of Behaviour Oriented Design (BOD) to develop agents with reactive planning and of the well-established OperA framework to provide organisational, social, and interaction definitions in order to validate and adjust agents’ behaviours. Together, OperA and BOD can achieve real-time adjustment of agent plans for evolving social roles, while providing the additional benefit of transparency into the interactions that drive this behavioural change in individual agents. We present this architecture to motivate the bridging between traditional symbolic- and behaviour-based AI communities, where such combined solutions can help MAS researchers in their pursuit of building stronger, more robust intelligent agent teams. We use DOTA2—a game where success is heavily dependent on social interactions—as a medium to demonstrate a sample implementation of our proposed hybrid architecture.},

This would in particular be the case for the AI strategies of the Nordic countries, at least given their high ranking and overall political focus when it comes to the achievement of the SDGs. In this paper, we present an analysis of existing AI recommendations from 10 different countries or organisations based on topic modelling techniques to identify how much these strategy documents refer to the SDGs. The analysis shows no significant difference on how much these documents refer to SDGs. Moreover, the Nordic countries are not different from the others albeit their long-term commitment to SDGs. More importantly, references to gender equality (SDG 5) and inequality (SDG 10), as well as references to environmental impact of AI development and use, and in particular the consequences for life on earth, are notably missing from the guidelines.},

	abstract={Different people have different perceptions about artificial intelligence (AI). It is extremely important to bring together all the alternative frames of thinking—from the various communities of developers, researchers, business leaders, policymakers, and citizens—to properly start acknowledging AI. This article highlights the ‘fruitful collaboration’ that sociology and AI could develop in both social and technical terms. We discuss how biases and unfairness are among the major challenges to be addressed in such a sociotechnical perspective. First, as intelligent machines reveal their nature of ‘magnifying glasses’ in the automation of existing inequalities, we show how the AI technical community is calling for transparency and explainability, accountability and contestability. Not to be considered as panaceas, they all contribute to ensuring human control in novel practices that include requirement, design and development methodologies for a fairer AI. Second, we elaborate on the mounting attention for technological narratives as technology is recognized as a social practice within a specific institutional context. Not only do narratives reflect organizing visions for society, but they also are a tangible sign of the traditional lines of social, economic, and political inequalities. We conclude with a call for a diverse approach within the AI community and a richer knowledge about narratives as they help in better addressing future technical developments, public debate, and policy. AI practice is interdisciplinary by nature and it will benefit from a socio-technical perspective.},

    title={Let Me Take Over: Variable Autonomy For Meaningful Human Control},      
    journal={Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence},
	abstract={As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to expand its reach, the demand for human control and the development of AI systems that adhere to our legal, ethical, and social values also grows. Many (international and national) institutions have taken steps in this direction and published guidelines for the development and deployment of responsible AI systems. These guidelines, however, rely heavily on high-level statements that provide no clear criteria for system assessment, making the effective control over systems a challenge. “Human oversight” is one of the requirements being put forward as a means to support human autonomy and agency. In this paper, we argue that human presence alone does not meet this requirement and that such a misconception may limit the use of automation where it can otherwise provide so much benefit across industries. We therefore propose the development of systems with variable autonomy—dynamically adjustable levels of autonomy—as a means of ensuring meaningful human control over an artefact by satisfying all three core values commonly advocated in ethical guidelines: accountability, responsibility, and transparency.},

    abstract = {This paper is preoccupied with the following question: given a (possibly opaque) learning
	system, how can we understand whether its behaviour adheres to governance constraints?
	The answer can be quite simple: we just need to "ask" the system about it. We propose
	to construct an investigator agent to query a learning agent-- the suspect agent--
	to investigate its adherence to a given ethical policy in the context of an information-seeking
	dialogue, modeled in formal argumentation settings. This formal dialogue framework
	is the main contribution of this paper. Through it, we break down compliance checking
	mechanisms into three modular components, each of which can be tailored to various
	needs in a vast amount of ways: an investigator agent, a suspect agent, and an acceptance
	protocol determining whether the responses of the suspect agent comply with the policy.
	This acceptance protocol presents a fundamentally different approach to aggregation:
	rather than using quantitative methods to deal with the non-determinism of a learning
	system, we leverage the use of argumentation semantics to investigate the notion of
	properties holding consistently. Overall, we argue that the introduced formal dialogue
	framework opens many avenues both in the area of compliance checking and in the analysis
	of properties of opaque systems.},

This paper investigates the type of assurances that are needed in the contesting process when algorithmic black-boxes are involved, opening new questions about the interplay of contestability and explainability. We argue that specialised complementary methodologies to evaluate automated decision-making in the case of a particular decision being contested need to be developed. Further, we propose a combination of well-established software engineering and rule-based approaches as a possible socio-technical solution to the issue of contestability, one of the new democratic challenges posed by the automation of decision making.},

	abstract={Unlike other human-made objects, the ability for intelligent systems to exhibit agency, and even appear anthropomorphic, leads to moral confusion about their status in society. As Himma states “If something walks, talks, and behaves enough like me, I might not be justified in thinking that it has a mind, but I surely have an obligation, if our ordinary reactions regarding other people are correct, to treat them as if they are moral agents.” Here, I present an evaluation of the requirements for moral agency and moral patiency. I examine human morality through a presentation of a high-level ontology of the human action-selection system. Then, drawing parallels between natural and artificial intelligence, I discuss the limitations and bottlenecks of intelligence, demonstrating how an ‘all-powerful’ Artificial General Intelligence would not only entail omniscience, but also be impossible. I demonstrate throughout this Chapter how culture determines the moral status of all entities, as morality and law are human-made ‘fictions’ that help us guide our actions. This means that our moral spectrum can be altered to include machines. However, there are both descriptive and normative arguments for why such a move is not only avoidable, but also should be avoided.},

In this chapter we review the necessity and tractability of maintaining human control, and the mechanisms by which this can be achieved.

This can be also disadvantageous for implementing transparency to agents, an important ethical consideration [1], [2], as additional work is needed to expose and represent information to end users. We are working towards the development of a new editor, ABOD3.

	abstract = {Transparency is a key consideration for the ethical design and use of Artificial Intelligence, and has recently become a topic of considerable public interest and debate. We frequently use philosophical, mathematical, and biologically inspired techniques for building artificial, interactive, intelligent agents. Yet despite these well-motivated inspirations, the resulting intelligence is often developed as a black box, communicating no understanding of how the underlying real-time decision making functions. This compromises both the safety of such systems and fair attribution of moral responsibility and legal accountability when incidents occur. This dissertation provides the knowledge and software tools to make artificially intelligent agents more transparent, allowing a direct understanding of the action-selection system of such a system. The use of transparency, as demonstrated in this document, helps not only with the debugging of intelligent agents, but also with the public's understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by removing the 'scary' mystery around "why is it behaving like that". In the research described in this document I investigate and compare the perception we have of intelligent systems, such as robots and autonomous vehicles, when they are treated as black boxes compared to when we make their action-selection systems transparent. Finally, I make normative and descriptive arguments for the moral status of intelligent systems and contribute to regulatory policy regarding such systems.},

We developed an intervention—the Sustainability Game (SG)—to allow players to experience the consequences of individual investment strategies on a sustainable society. Results show that the intervention significantly increases individuals’ cooperative behaviour in partially anonymised public goods contexts, but enhances competition one-on-one.

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are being used to predict and assess behaviour in multiple domains, such as criminal justice and consumer finance, which directly affect human well-being. However, if AI is to improve people's lives, then people must be able to trust AI, which means being able to understand what the system is doing and why. Even though transparency is often seen as the requirement in this case, realistically it might not always be possible or desirable, whereas the need to ensure that the system operates within set moral bounds remains. In this paper, we present an approach to evaluate the moral bounds of an AI system based on the monitoring of its inputs and outputs. We place a "glass box" around the system by mapping moral values into explicit verifiable norms that constrain inputs and outputs, in such a way that if these remain within the box we can guarantee that the system adheres to the value. The focus on inputs and outputs allows for the verification and comparison of vastly different intelligent systems; from deep neural networks to agent-based systems. The explicit transformation of abstract moral values into concrete norms brings great benefits in terms of explainability; stakeholders know exactly how the system is interpreting and employing relevant abstract moral human values and calibrate their trust accordingly. Moreover, by operating at a higher level we can check the compliance of the system with different interpretations of the same value. These advantages will have an impact on the well-being of AI systems users at large, building their trust and providing them with concrete knowledge on how systems adhere to moral values.},

(2) the artificial nature of AV was made explicitly clear in the pre-study briefing, but its decisionmaking system was kept opaque, and (3) a transparent AV that reported back the characteristics of
the NPCs that influenced its decision-making process. In this paper, we discuss our results, including
the distress expressed by our participants at exposing them to a system that makes decisions based
on socio-demographic attributes, and their implications.},

	abstract = {Autonomous robots can be difficult to design and understand. Designers have difficulty decoding the behaviour of their own robots simply by observing them. Naive users of robots similarly have diculty decoding robot behaviour simply through observation. In this paper we review relevant robot systems architecture, design and transparency literature, and report on a programme of research to investigate practical approaches to improve robot transparency. We report on the investigation of real-time graphical and vocalised outputs as a means for both designers and end users to gain a better mental model of the internal state and decision making processes taking place within a robot. This approach, combined with a graphical approach to behaviour design, o ers improved transparency for robot designers. We also report on studies of users' understanding, where significant improvement has been achieved using both graphical and vocalisation transparency approaches.},

As we interact with complex intelligent artefacts, humans inevitably construct mental models to understand and predict their behaviour. If these models are incorrect or inadequate, we run the risk of self deception or even harm. This paper reports progress on a programme of work investigating approaches for implementing robot transparency, and the effects of these approaches on utility, trust and the perception of agency. Preliminary findings indicate that building transparency into robot action selection can help users build a more accurate understanding of the robot.},

	abstract = {Autonomous robots can be difficult to understand by their develop-ers, let alone by end users. Yet, as they become increasingly integralparts of our societies, the need for affordable easy to use tools toprovide transparency grows. The rise of the smartphone and theimprovements in mobile computing performance have graduallyallowed Augmented Reality (AR) to become more mobile and afford-able. In this paper we review relevant robot systems architectureand propose a new software tool to provide robot transparencythrough the use of AR technology. Our new tool, ABOD3-AR pro-vides real-time graphical visualisation and debugging of a robot’sgoals and priorities as a means for both designers and end usersto gain a better mental model of the internal state and decisionmaking processes taking place within a robot.
