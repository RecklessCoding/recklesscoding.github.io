description: Bridging AI Research & Real-World Value
---

In an era where Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer just a buzzword but a core business driver, many organizations rush to "How do we build it?" or "Which model should we buy?" before they truly understand their own operational, ethical, and legal requirements.

# Services Offered
Before investing in infrastructure, both hardware and software, we need to determine if AI is actually the solution and istinguish what is hype and actually has real buiness value. Ensuring that AI implementation maps directly to business goals; whether that's cost reduction, enhanced user experience, or improve reliability and delivery of services. Sometimes, a robust data strategy or a simple heuristic is more effective (and cheaper) than the latest large-language model.

I help organisations navigate the complex landscape of global AI policy—including the EU AI Act, ISO/IEC standards, and IEEE frameworks. I can provide audit readiness; aide at setting up appropriate controls (e.g. user policies, AI management systems, AI asset repositories, and others).

In collaboration with engineering, I can embed ethical and regulatory checkpoints directly into your Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) pipeline. Such controls include adversarial testing, prompt injection, explanation generations, and fairness testing.

Tailored training for technical teams and executives on AI safety and governance.
